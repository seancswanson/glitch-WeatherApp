  <h1>Thank you so much for your time!</h1>
  <p>
    You've stumbled across Nubis.io, a weather forecast SPA that I built to
    improve my web development chops.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nubis.io is the first project that I've built using
    <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for the front end. This app
    was meant to be a quick proof of concept for an AngularJS app so I didn't
    invest time in setting up a build/tooling system proper. Instead, I used
    some nifty plugins for my code editor (VSCode is my goto but I've been
    experimenting with Brackets) to compile my LESS stylesheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the project ended up morphing into something a bit larger, I've
    learned that I ought to streamline the process of setting up front end
    tooling to get it into my projects before it gets unwieldy. It's hard to
    anticipate how a project will entice you to build it out past your initial
    MVP. I've been looking into Parcel and will use it for my next project.
